# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
PR #2 had merge conflicts that prevented it from being merged into the main branch.

## Root Cause
- The PR branch (copilot/fix-a677abe6-d605-41a9-ab53-b1f1c295a4f9) was based on an older commit
- Main branch had been updated with changes from PR #1 (commit c12bbf3)
- This created unrelated histories and conflicts in multiple files

## Resolution Process
1. Fetched latest main branch with merged changes
2. Rebased PR branch onto updated main (c12bbf3)
3. Resolved conflicts in 4 files:
   - README.md: Combined feature descriptions
   - index.html: Integrated enhanced UI with fallback system
